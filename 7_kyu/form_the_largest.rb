# Task
# Given a number , Return _The Maximum number _ could be formed from the digits of the number given .

# Notes
# Only Positive numbers passed to the function , numbers Contain digits [1:9] inclusive  !alt !alt

# Digit Duplications could occur , So also consider it when forming the Largest  !alt


# Test Cases:
# maxNumber (213) ==> return (321)
# maxNumber (7389) ==> return (9873)
# maxNumber (63729) ==> return (97632)

# Find the next largest number greater than 'n' that is

# Easier and harder way
# Use the method from the earlier problem
# There is a way to "brute force" it

next_largest(1345) == 1435

next_largest(1111) == -1
